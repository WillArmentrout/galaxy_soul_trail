-3200000000.0;Cells resembling prokaryotes appear.[24] These first organisms are chemoautotrophs: they use carbon dioxide as a carbon source and oxidize inorganic materials to extract energy.

Glycolysis (and ATP) continue to be used in almost all organisms, unchanged, to this day.[25][26];https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_evolutionary_history_of_life;-3200000000;-3200000000

The oxygen concentration in the atmosphere slowly rose, acting as a poison for many bacteria and eventually triggering the Great Oxygenation Event. The Moon, still very close to Earth, caused tides 1,000 feet (305 m) high.[citation needed] The Earth was continually wracked by hurricane-force winds.

The rising temperatures will increase chemical reactions in the atmosphere, further lowering oxygen levels. Flying animals would be better off because of their ability to travel large distances looking for cooler temperatures.[65] Many animals may be driven to the poles or possibly underground. These creatures would become active during the polar night and hibernate during the polar day due to the intense heat and radiation. Much of the land would become a barren desert, and plants and animals would primarily be found in the oceans.[66];https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future;750000000;750000000
800000000.0;Carbon dioxide levels fall to the point at which C4 photosynthesis is no longer possible.[64] Without plant life to recycle oxygen in the atmosphere, free oxygen and the ozone layer will disappear from the atmosphere allowing for intense levels of deadly UV light to reach the surface.
